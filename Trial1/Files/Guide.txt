__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Alert – notify people around you and authorities of the problem.

Lockdown – secure yourself in a location so it’s hard for a terrorist to get to you and those nearby.

Inform – continue to keep authorities apprised of the situation and know your surroundings.

Counter – if you have no other options, confront or interrupt the attacker.

Escape/Evade/Evacuate – if you can escape the situation safely, then do so.

And the other:

Stay positive – A calm and collected attitude of optimism avoids panic, maintains clear thinking, and the preserves belief of survival.

Know the source of danger – Where is the threat? Know where the danger is coming from and stay away.

Find the exits – Attempt to get away from the immediate danger. Find the nearest avenue to an escape as possible.

Arm yourself – Anything can be used as a weapon. Make yourself as dangerous as possible in the event you are forced to defend yourself.

Move quickly – Never plan on staying still. Always be prepared to move and quickly get to where ever it is you need to go.

Use cover – when on the move, move from one strong point to the next, never staying in open longer than is needed.

Avoid traveling along walls – Bullets travel along walls. Try to stay at least six or so inches from the wall if you can.
